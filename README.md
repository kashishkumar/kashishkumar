### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Data Scientist at ExxonMobil | Computer Vision | IIT Madras | PEC Chandigarh. 

I'm currently working as a Data Scientist at ExxonMobil in the Modelling Optimisation and Data Science team. I'm working on a computer vision project of detecting industrial equipment and classifying them based on their corrosion damage levels. 

Prior to that I was working as a Data Scientist and also taking care of backend engineering at Vaya which is a fintech startup focusing on providing credit to platform based small businesses in United States. 

I worked as a Senior Associate at upGrad in the space of online course creation related to AI and Data Science. I write, teach, mentor and code. I'm also an avid reader, content creator and have a personal blog where I write about personal development and shares other educational content.

During my masters, my research was on an interdisciplinary project applying machine learning to improve the structural optimization process which led me to the field of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. My areas of interest include machine learning, structural engineering, sustainability, and personal finance along with some economics.

I believe that my strongest attributes are intuitive thinking, the ability to understand from different perspectives and an independent self-drive to work on valuable and interesting things. I am a curious polymath seeking to apply ideas from one field to the other by working in unexplored intersections.
